## Installation

To begin using the `epicvault-api`, you’ll first need to install both the `epicvault-api` and `epicvault-core` packages. This can be done easily with npm or yarn.

### Using npm:

```sh
npm install @epicchain/epicvault-api @epicchain/epicvault-core
```

### Using yarn:

```sh
yarn add @epicchain/epicvault-api @epicchain/epicvault-core
```

## Setup and Configuration

Before using the API, you'll need to configure the environment for accessing the EpicVault platform. This includes setting up the EpicVault network, API keys (if needed), and any other necessary configuration parameters.

### Example Configuration:

```javascript
const { EpicVaultAPI } = require('@epicchain/epicvault-api');
const { EpicVaultCore } = require('@epicchain/epicvault-core');

const api = new EpicVaultAPI({
  network: 'mainnet', // or 'testnet' depending on your environment
  apiKey: 'your-api-key-here', // optional, if the API requires authentication
});

const core = new EpicVaultCore({
  privateKey: 'your-wallet-private-key-here',
  rpcUrl: 'https://your-epicchain-node-url',
});
```

## Usage

The `epicvault-api` offers a variety of functions to interact with the EpicVault platform. Below are some common use cases for the API.

### Example 1: Creating a Transaction

To create a transaction on the EpicVault platform, you can use the following method:

```javascript
const { EpicVaultAPI } = require('@epicchain/epicvault-api');

const api = new EpicVaultAPI();

// Create a transaction object
const transaction = {
  from: '0xYourWalletAddress',
  to: '0xReceiverAddress',
  amount: '1000', // Amount of tokens to send
  token: 'XPR', // Token type (EpicChain token)
};

// Send transaction
async function sendTransaction() {
  try {
    const txHash = await api.createTransaction(transaction);
    console.log('Transaction Hash:', txHash);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending transaction:', error);
  }
}

sendTransaction();
```

### Example 2: Interacting with Liquidity Pools

You can interact with liquidity pools on the EpicVault platform to add or remove liquidity, perform swaps, and more.

```javascript
const { EpicVaultCore } = require('@epicchain/epicvault-core');
const { EpicVaultAPI } = require('@epicchain/epicvault-api');

const core = new EpicVaultCore({ privateKey: 'your-wallet-private-key' });
const api = new EpicVaultAPI();

// Example of adding liquidity to a pool
async function addLiquidity() {
  const liquidityDetails = {
    poolId: '0xLiquidityPoolId',
    tokenA: 'XPR', // Token A in the pair
    tokenB: 'XPP', // Token B in the pair
    amountA: '1000', // Amount of Token A to add
    amountB: '500',  // Amount of Token B to add
  };

  try {
    const transaction = await api.addLiquidity(liquidityDetails);
    console.log('Liquidity Added:', transaction);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error adding liquidity:', error);
  }
}

addLiquidity();
```

### Example 3: Querying Blockchain Data

You can query blockchain data such as transaction history, account balances, and more using the API.

```javascript
async function getAccountBalance(address) {
  try {
    const balance = await api.getAccountBalance(address);
    console.log(`Account Balance for ${address}:`, balance);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving account balance:', error);
  }
}

getAccountBalance('0xYourWalletAddress');
```
