`neon-js` is laid out in a modules style, with each folder in the source code
representing a module with a particular functionality.

## default

The default import for Neon is a Javascript object where functions are arranged
in a semantic manner following the convention of Verb-Noun. If a method goes
beyond 2 levels, the rest of the name is camelCased at the noun level.

```js
import Neon from "@cityofzion/neon-js";
Neon.create.privateKey();
Neon.serialize.tx(transactionObj);
Neon.get.publicKeyFromPrivateKey(privateKey);
```

This style is recommended for beginners or anyone who just wishes to use Neon
without hassle.

## api

The `api` module contains code that interfaces with external APIs as well as
providing a high level abstraction.

## wallet

The `wallet` module deals with key manipulating as well as importing and
exporting of wallet files.

## tx

The `tx` module deals with transaction creation, serialization and
deserialization.

## sc

The `sc` module deals with smart contract script construction. It is used
primarily to construct scripts that can be carried by InvocationTransaction.

## rpc

The `rpc` module deals with the RPC interface exposed by the NEO node.

## u

The `u` module is the utilities module containing methods handling the various
data transformation aspects within NEO.

## CONST

modules.
